# AnalysisGrowth
The "Plant Growth Analysis" project aims to monitor and analyze the growth of plants over a specified period of time. Below, we present the project's code and its description.

In the project, we have data on the growth of plants over the course of a week (variable "growth"). The project's code performs the following operations:

Sorting the plant growth data to find the smallest and largest growth over the course of the week. The results are displayed on the screen.

Calculating the average plant growth over the week and displaying the result.

Adding new data about plant growth over two weeks (variable "new_growth") and combining it with the data from the first week (variable "joined_growth").

Recalculating the smallest, largest, and average growth over the two-week period and displaying the results.

Counting how many times the smallest and largest growth occurred over the two weeks and displaying this information.

The project enables the monitoring and analysis of plant growth data to understand the dynamics and growth trends over a specified period of time. This is valuable for farmers and gardeners to better manage their crops and care for their plants.
